# TSCrypto

Basically cryptography & math stuff in TypeScript, totally for educational purposes. The code here is probably as unoptimized as it may get, but I tend to take care on DX for the API.

## Implementations

The following are implemented:

### https://github.com/erhant/tscrypto/labels/finite%20fields

- [x] Basic finite field arithmetic of assumed prime order.
- [x] Finite field extensions with an irreducible polynomial.
- [ ] Finite field projections.

### https://github.com/erhant/tscrypto/labels/polynomials

- [x] Polynomial arithmetic with coefficients in a finite field.
- [x] Lagrange Interpolation.

### https://github.com/erhant/tscrypto/labels/elliptic%20curves

- [x] Affine Short Weierstrass curves.
- [ ] Projective Short Weierstrass curves.
